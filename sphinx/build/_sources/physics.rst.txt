This section will give a short summary of Dark matter and the basic physics behind the analysis we will go through in the school.

Dark Matter
~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the open questions of modern-day physics is related to the properties of DM. 
The existence of dark matter is implied through several astrophysical obseervations including
galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background. 

Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are a hypothetical proposed candidate for DM.
While there is no rigid definition of what constitutes a WIMP, they are generally new elemental
particles that interact with the SM as weak or weaker than the weak nuclear force.

In spite of the abundance of DM, its nature remains unknown. This mystery is the subject
of an active experimental program to search for dark matter particles, including direct-detection
experiments that search for interactions of ambient DM with ordinary matter, indirect-detection
experiments that search for the products of self-annihilation of DM in outer space, and searches at
accelerators and colliders that attempt to create DM in the laboratory. The figure below shows a diagram
showing the different detection techniques used to search for evidence of DM. The arrows indicate
the flow of time for the different interactions, yielding a different combination of SM and DM
particles.

We will focus on DM produced at the LHC, but brief descriptions of Direct and Indirect detection are explained below.

Simplified Dark Matter at CMS
*****************************
With DM particles in the GeV and TeV mass range,
experiments at the LHC may be able to detect DM particles produced in the proton-proton (pp)
collisions. Because DM will have negligible interactions with the SM, the DM particles would not
be detected by typical detector systems, instead appearing as large amounts of missing transverse
momentum. The search presented in this thesis considers a “mono-Z” scenario where a Z boson, produced
in pp collisions, recoils against DM or other beyond the standard model (BSM) invisible particles.
The Z boson subsequently decays into two charged leptons.
This school focuses on thisa dilepton signature, and the accompanying undetected particles contribute to missing transverse
momentum.

For this school we will examine a set of simplified models for DM production. These models describe
the phenomenology of DM production at the LHC with a small number of parameters and
provide a standard for comparing and combining results from different search channels.
Four simple ultraviolet-complete models that contain a massive mediator exchanged in the s-channel are
considered. For these models, the mediator (either a scalar, psuedoscalar, vector, or axial-vector)
couples directly to quarks and the DM particle χ, where χ is assumed to be a Dirac fermion.
Here, the couplings to Standard model quarks, the coupling to dark matter and
the mediator mass are all tunable parameters leading to a wide variety of kinematic possibilities.

Direct Detection
****************

Direct detection experiments attempt to collect direct evidence for the presence of dark matter
through the observation of low energy elastic collisions between DM particles and atomic nuclei.
As DM particles pass through the Earth, they can collide with a nucleus that will emit energy (on
the order of keV) as scintillation light or as phonons as they pass through a sensitive apparatus.
These apparatuses are often buried deep underground in order to reduce the background, specifically from cosmic rays. 
Direct detection experiments primarily use either cryogenic detectors,
operating at temperatures below 100 mK, or liquid detector technologies that detect scintillation
originating from a collision with a noble liquid or metalloid, such as a xenon, argon or germanium
nuclei. 

While no evidence for DM has been found from direct detection experiments, several experiments have placed limits on the nucleon cross sections of DM interactions. Some example of recent
limits from noble liquid experiments include recent results from the XENON1T,
the Large Underground Xenon (LUX), the DarkSide-50 and the PandaX-ll experiments. 
Results from cryogenic detectors include the CRESST-III, the CDMS and SuperCDMS experiments, while additional results from bubble chambers include the PICO-60
and PICO-2L experiments.

Indirect Detection
******************
Indirect detection experiments aim to search for particles originating from the self-annihilation or
decay of dark matter particles in the universe. In regions of high dark matter density, DM particles
could collide, annihilate and produce SM particles, either in particle-antiparticle pairs or through
high energy photons (gamma rays). If the DM particles are inherently unstable, they could also
decay into SM particles. Both of these processes have potential to be detected indirectly through
observations of excess amounts of gamma rays, antiprotons or positrons.

In addition to self-annihilation in space, excess neutrinos from stars such as our sun may indicate the presence of DM. 
As DM particles pass through massive objects, they may scatter off SM
particles, losing energy. This could cause an accumulation of DM particles at the center of massive
objects. If these DM self-annihilate, they could be observed as an excess amount of high energy
neutrinos originating from these bodies

Several experiments are already searching for these distinct signatures. The Fermi-LAT 
looks for excess gamma rays. The PAMELA experiment has observed an excess of
positrons, that could be caused from DM particle annihilation of from pulsars. The PAMELA
experiment also searched for excess antiprotons but did not observe any excess. The Alpha Mag29
netic Spectrometer (AMS-02), located on the international space station, also indicated an
excess of high energy positrons. The IceCube and Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatories have 
presented constraints on the annihilation cross section from searches for an excess neutrino flux.
